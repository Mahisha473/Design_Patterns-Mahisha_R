# Design_Patterns-Mahisha_R
This repository contains Java implementations of six software design patterns: Observer, Strategy, Singleton, Factory, Adapter, and Decorator. Each pattern is in its own folder with a console demo. The project shows how OOP concepts and patterns improve flexibility, reusability, and maintainability of code.
